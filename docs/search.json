His buddy Soderbergh, another Steven, edited the movie to remove all colour and all sound, and posted it online here. You can still understand every single thing that’s going on—characters, intentions, tensions, pace. That’s not film stars or magic, it’s just a guy who knows how to direct. Leaving aside technical mastery of all things cinema, the story of the ark is very cool. The ark is essentially a box of Gods. In this movie, the MacGuffin is very much alive."

It is the ancient idol sought by the archaeologist, the elusive piece of evidence that the detective needs to close the case.\nThe McG is extremely useful in storytelling, especially in cinema where it can occupy a space in the viewer’s mind even if it has been shown only in passing or not at all. I was trying to think of real-life McGs, and I was struggling. But I have come up with something. Each of us has a McG inside; in fact, we usually have multitudes. I am thinking of the imagined versions of things we hold in our head and let drive our story. In this sense, the McG can have positive or negative impacts in our lives, and this is unknown while the search is still going on. We must strive to make our McGs mysterious and engaging; they must make us see life as a whole and not divide it into shorter chases. It must not be good or bad, and evolution must be in its nature."

It is her way of telling women they are not alone in their pain, always a good thing, and telling men not to worry about being forgotten.\nI was struck by this piece of art and enjoyed all of it. It is good from a stylistic point and from a meta-commentary point. My favourite character was the Priest. Although I do not reach a third of his ability to earnestly engage and care—after all, he has God on his side—I have always enjoyed intently trying to understand and help people I care about. I was rooting for a Fleabag-Priest union but I see that it could not have ended that way, and the heart-breaking yet hopeful ending was perfect.

Born in 1914, Plomley was a polyvalent radio-man—broadcasting, producing, and writing hundreds of times. Legend has it he conceived the show’s unique format during a late-night brainstorming session. The idea was simple yet profound: invite notable figures to imagine themselves cast away on a deserted island and discuss the eight records they would take with them.\nFor 40 years Plomley reigned, conducting intimate interviews that revealed the personal stories and musical tastes of his subjects. His warm demeanour and genuine curiosity set the tone for the show, and those are the only facets on which we can really assess the hosts.\nPlomley conducts himself with a curiosity that is playful and laid-back. His warmth is almost palpable. It is clear I have a positive opinion of Roy Plomley.\nNotable guests: Paul McCartney, Elizabeth Taylor, Alfred Hitchcock, Margaret Thatcher."

    "section": "The lyrics quote: (Replaced by some thoughts on “Azzurro”)",
    "text": "The lyrics quote: (Replaced by some thoughts on “Azzurro”)\nInternationally, and fashion notwithstanding, “Azzurro” I would argue is not only the most well-known Italian song, but also the best and the one with most artistic merit. Other contenders are “Nel blu, dipinto di blu” (Volare), “Bella Ciao” (barely a song), some opera which does not really count, and Raffaella Carrà, which I can enjoy but don’t like very much.\nThe song would not have been so popular if not performed by Adriano Celentano, but its lyrics originate from true masters of the folk song, real singer-songwriters Paolo Conte and Vito Pallavicini. Conte has said that the popular version by Celentano is the best rendition of the song, which I think betrays his humble nature, or perhaps an inability to grasp the depth of his own creation, or both.\nRather than a verse-by-verse analysis—which would be fun but too long—I will look at some specific parts.\nThe title of the song translates to “Blue”, but it is important to note that Italian lacks the blue=sad connotation that exists in English. In fact, blue, or more specifically “azzurro”, has some positive associations such as being the national colour of the football (and other sports) teams, with the team referred to as “the blues”, when they are in fact quite a happy bunch. Also, the Prince Charming of fables is known as “il principe azzurro”. While the previous bit is true, Conte did like his jazz and boogie and Latin-American rhythms, and he was probably aware of the blue=sad thing. Moving on.\nInterestingly, two of the most famous Italian songs make heavy use of this colour. I have no idea what this means. But there is a difference between “azzurro” and “blu”. “Blu” is blue, a dark and intense shade, and a more generic word, whereas “azzurro” is a lighter shade, towards sky-blue and cyan—it is what happens when you mix “blu” with “bianco” (white), I guess. Also, the most accurate translation I just realized might be “azure”, which even sounds like “azzurro”. Really moving on now.\nCerco l’estate tutto l’anno,\ne all’improvviso eccola qua\n(Spending year looking for summer,\nall of a sudden here it is)\nStrong start, hard not to relate, just a few words and you’re already agreeing with him.\nLei è partita per le spiagge\ne sono solo quassù in città\n(She left to the beaches,\nand I am alone up here in the city)\nIntroduces the seeming fact that this is a song about the singer’s thoughts on a woman that he longs for. Also, an interesting point is the use of “quassù”, meaning “up here”, instead of “quaggiù”, meaning “down here”, or just “qua” (here). This might refer to the singer’s geographic location in some mountainous area. At least one of the writers comes from Piedmont, a mountainous area in northwest Italy almost entirely surrounded by the Alps. The keen reader might have noticed that Piedmont (Piemonte) is named so because it is at the foot (piede) of the mountains (monti); this is even more obvious from French. And yet, the region is not so far from the sea, which is accessible via nearby Liguria, which won the monopoly of regional sea access—and pesto—in a game of cards in 1556.\nIn the next few lines, we learn that he hears an airplane above him, that the evening is too “azzurro” and long for him, and finally that he might get on a train and go to her. The train is an important element and curiously the second method of transportation to be introduced. I believe it stands in antithesis to the plane, which is fast and thoughtless. The train, with its rhythmic lulling sounds and ground-level views, allows for a much more spiritually intense journey, one where the traveller can truly change as they move through the landscape and feel this change as they approach the final destination. But what really is this destination?\nMa il treno dei desideri nei miei\npensieri all’incontrario va\n(Yet the train of desires in my\nthoughts travels the opposite way)\nThis is the end of the chorus and the turning point. Conte uses an “enjambement”, which he likes to do and I like to hear—in Spanish “encabalgamiento”, still “enjambement” in English—that’s when a sentence is split by the verse, I think. I have kept it in the translation to illustrate the point although it does not sound so good in English.\nSo what does this mean? It is really evocative. There was a real train, which he might take to go to the beach, but now it turns to a metaphorical train, and it is a train that represents his desires, and then we learn that it is also going in reverse! Reverse from where? Is it moving away from her? In a way. He conveys that aside and perhaps more deeply than the longing for the woman, he is feeling a longing for the past. He does not desire (wish) to go forward, but to go back. He is letting us know that he wants to revisit some of the earlier stations in his life. Immediately in the next lines he puts himself in his childhood memories: he is strolling through an empty recreation center, he is looking for an African tree, he comes back to the present to tell us that doing this now would not be possible because there are in fact people around, and then he asks himself where the lions have gone. Conte, in a very short space, has created an oneiric (dream-like) scene, with several softly confusing overlapping images. We are left here with a layered image of a man wanting to go somewhere, maybe forwards towards a woman and the future, or backwards to a summer day and childhood—not for fun and excitement but for a different kind of solitude.\nOkay, that was long, so the rest will be short. There would be more to say, also about the “Genius” annotations on this song which I think are not very good except for this hilarious one.\n\n“Quando registrammo il pezzo, Celentano se ne stava in un angolo da solo e ripeteva: ‘tra l’oleandro e il babalù’”\n— Paolo Conte, Venerdì di Repubblica, 25 maggio 2018."

My immediate conscious experience post-run will follow and close this edition:\nIt is 18:54, so this is not an immediate reaction. I ran for 1hr 54mins, a record for me. The views and temperature were fantastic, the road not very busy, the peaches I had at home right after felt otherworldly. Tomorrow I will be feeling the consequences, mainly in the left sole as it was already feeling tight mid-run, and the calves because that is where I feel 5km the day after—this was more than four times that. The mild euphoria has completely left, and my core temperature has lowered; if one is not careful, the shock and relative feeling can make it seem like one is feeling down.\nUntil next time."
