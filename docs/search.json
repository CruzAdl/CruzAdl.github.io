His buddy Soderbergh, another Steven, edited the movie to remove all colour and all sound, and posted it online here. You can still understand every single thing that’s going on—characters, intentions, tensions, pace. That’s not film stars or magic, it’s just a guy who knows how to direct. Leaving aside technical mastery of all things cinema, the story of the ark is very cool. The ark is essentially a box of Gods. In this movie, the MacGuffin is very much alive."

It is the ancient idol sought by the archaeologist, the elusive piece of evidence that the detective needs to close the case.\nThe McG is extremely useful in storytelling, especially in cinema where it can occupy a space in the viewer’s mind even if it has been shown only in passing or not at all. I was trying to think of real-life McGs, and I was struggling. But I have come up with something. Each of us has a McG inside; in fact, we usually have multitudes. I am thinking of the imagined versions of things we hold in our head and let drive our story. In this sense, the McG can have positive or negative impacts in our lives, and this is unknown while the search is still going on. We must strive to make our McGs mysterious and engaging; they must make us see life as a whole and not divide it into shorter chases. It must not be good or bad, and evolution must be in its nature."

It is her way of telling women they are not alone in their pain, always a good thing, and telling men not to worry about being forgotten.\nI was struck by this piece of art and enjoyed all of it. It is good from a stylistic point and from a meta-commentary point. My favourite character was the Priest. Although I do not reach a third of his ability to earnestly engage and care—after all, he has God on his side—I have always enjoyed intently trying to understand and help people I care about. I was rooting for a Fleabag-Priest union but I see that it could not have ended that way, and the heart-breaking yet hopeful ending was perfect. Thank you Phoebe Waller-Bridge, I love you, but fear not, it will pass."

    "section": "The lyrics quote: (Replaced by some thoughts on “Azzurro”)",
    "text": "The lyrics quote: (Replaced by some thoughts on “Azzurro”)\nInternationally, and fashion notwithstanding, “Azzurro” I would argue is not only the most well-known Italian song, but also the best and the one with most artistic merit. Other contenders are “Nel blu, dipinto di blu” (Volare), “Bella Ciao” (barely a song), some opera which does not really count, and Raffaella Carrà, which I can enjoy but don’t like very much.\nThe song would not have been so popular if not performed by Adriano Celentano, but its lyrics originate from true masters of the folk song, real singer-songwriters Paolo Conte and Vito Pallavicini. Conte has said that the popular version by Celentano is the best rendition of the song, which I think betrays his humble nature, or perhaps an inability to grasp the depth of his own creation, or both.\nRather than a verse-by-verse analysis—which would be fun but too long—I will look at some specific parts.\nThe title of the song translates to “Blue”, but it is important to note that Italian lacks the blue=sad connotation that exists in English. In fact, blue, or more specifically “azzurro”, has some positive associations such as being the national colour of the football (and other sports) teams, with the team referred to as “the blues”, when they are in fact quite a happy bunch. Also, the Prince Charming of fables is known as “il principe azzurro”. While the previous bit is true, Conte did like his jazz and boogie and Latin-American rhythms, and he was probably aware of the blue=sad thing. Moving on.\nInterestingly, two of the most famous Italian songs make heavy use of this colour. I have no idea what this means. But there is a difference between “azzurro” and “blu”. “Blu” is blue, a dark and intense shade, and a more generic word, whereas “azzurro” is a lighter shade, towards sky-blue and cyan—it is what happens when you mix “blu” with “bianco” (white), I guess. Also, the most accurate translation I just realized might be “azure”, which even sounds like “azzurro”. Really moving on now.\nCerco l’estate tutto l’anno,\ne all’improvviso eccola qua\n(Spending year looking for summer,\nall of a sudden here it is)\nStrong start, hard not to relate, just a few words and you’re already agreeing with him.\nLei è partita per le spiagge\ne sono solo quassù in città\n(She left to the beaches,\nand I am alone up here in the city)\nIntroduces the seeming fact that this is a song about the singer’s thoughts on a woman that he longs for. Also, an interesting point is the use of “quassù”, meaning “up here”, instead of “quaggiù”, meaning “down here”, or just “qua” (here). This might refer to the singer’s geographic location in some mountainous area. At least one of the writers comes from Piedmont, a mountainous area in northwest Italy almost entirely surrounded by the Alps. The keen reader might have noticed that Piedmont (Piemonte) is named so because it is at the foot (piede) of the mountains (monti); this is even more obvious from French. And yet, the region is not so far from the sea, which is accessible via nearby Liguria, which won the monopoly of regional sea access—and pesto—in a game of cards in 1556.\nIn the next few lines, we learn that he hears an airplane above him, that the evening is too “azzurro” and long for him, and finally that he might get on a train and go to her. The train is an important element and curiously the second method of transportation to be introduced. I believe it stands in antithesis to the plane, which is fast and thoughtless. The train, with its rhythmic lulling sounds and ground-level views, allows for a much more spiritually intense journey, one where the traveller can truly change as they move through the landscape and feel this change as they approach the final destination. But what really is this destination?\nMa il treno dei desideri nei miei\npensieri all’incontrario va\n(Yet the train of desires in my\nthoughts travels the opposite way)\nThis is the end of the chorus and the turning point. Conte uses an “enjambement”, which he likes to do and I like to hear—in Spanish “encabalgamiento”, still “enjambement” in English—that’s when a sentence is split by the verse, I think. I have kept it in the translation to illustrate the point although it does not sound so good in English.\nSo what does this mean? It is really evocative. There was a real train, which he might take to go to the beach, but now it turns to a metaphorical train, and it is a train that represents his desires, and then we learn that it is also going in reverse! Reverse from where? Is it moving away from her? In a way. He conveys that aside and perhaps more deeply than the longing for the woman, he is feeling a longing for the past. He does not desire (wish) to go forward, but to go back. He is letting us know that he wants to revisit some of the earlier stations in his life. Immediately in the next lines he puts himself in his childhood memories: he is strolling through an empty recreation center, he is looking for an African tree, he comes back to the present to tell us that doing this now would not be possible because there are in fact people around, and then he asks himself where the lions have gone. Conte, in a very short space, has created an oneiric (dream-like) scene, with several softly confusing overlapping images. We are left here with a layered image of a man wanting to go somewhere, maybe forwards towards a woman and the future, or backwards to a summer day and childhood—not for fun and excitement but for a different kind of solitude.\nOkay, that was long, so the rest will be short. There would be more to say, also about the “Genius” annotations on this song which I think are not very good except for this hilarious one.\n\n“Quando registrammo il pezzo, Celentano se ne stava in un angolo da solo e ripeteva: ‘tra l’oleandro e il babalù’”\n— Paolo Conte, Venerdì di Repubblica, 25 maggio 2018."

The initial idea was simple yet profound: invite notable figures to imagine themselves cast away on a deserted island and discuss the eight records they would take with them.\n40 years Plomley reigned, conducting intimate interviews that revealed the personal stories and musical tastes of his subjects. His warm demeanor and genuine curiosity set the tone for the show, and is important they are the only facets on which we can really assess the hosts.\nPlomley conducts himself with a curiousity that is playful and laid-back. His warm demeanor is almost palpable. It is clear I have a positive opinion of Roy Plomley.\nNotable guests: Paul McCartney, Elizabeth Taylor, Alfred Hitchcock, Margaret Thatcher."

She initially gained fame as the lead singer and guitarist of the Britpop band Kenickie before transitioning to broadcasting. Her deep knowledge of music is embodied in a near-peppy on-air personality. The result is very engaging and continues to elevate the original spirit of the show, one of curiosity and warmth.\nIn this she joins the men and women before her who gave voice to and presentend thousands of personal stories, and considerably more music. I hold Lauren Laverne in high regard.\nNotable guests: Louis Theroux, Ian Wright, Helena Bonham Carter, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers."

    "text": "The World Is Very Old\nThe world is very old,\nAnd so are the rocks and trees.\nThe world is very old,\nSo say the Egyptians and the Chinese.\nThe world is older than this book,\nBound in leathery skin.\nOlder also than this ancient,\nAnd mysterious dried-out seed.\nThe world is big,\nFrom sea to sea,\nAnd it is older,\nThan you or me.\n“The world is very old”\nIs an old world saying\nUttered first very long ago.\nBy a caveman near the fire\nOr a pharaoh on his throne\n“The world is very old”\nSang the mother to her son.\nHis eyes sky-bound and mouth open\nAsking “just how very old?”\n“Old as the rocks and trees,\nOr even more we do not know.\nAnd we must care for it together\nBecause we live in it,\nAnd it is very old”\nScampering around the fire,\nAncient wisdom in his brain,\nThe young boy finds the star-man,\nAnd ventures to explain.\n“The world is very old,” the star-man confirms,\n“And you should listen to your mother, for she seldom errs.”\nThe star-man turns his gaze from the blue dome to the earth\n“But tell me young man, are you thinking something else?”\nHe straightens his body and widens his stance, pointing at the horizon.\n“Star-man, I now know, that the rocks and trees, and birds and bees, are old,\nAnd so is the world, very old. The wisdom is clear, it is not lost on me.\nThe world is very old, more than you or me.\nBut Star-man I wonder, if nothing comes from nothing\nThere must be something no matter how strange\nEven older than the world, from which it came to be.”\nThe young man draws a circle on the ground,\nA lightly patterned stick moves the soft earth aside.\n“Star-man, we eat what we find, we wear what we make,\nAt night we light a fire and protect the tribe,\nWe matter to ourselves and fight beasts and foes.”\nThe stick rises from the ground, tracing the dimming border\nBetween brown and blue.\n“What good is it for us to know something older still,\nOlder than rocks and trees and birds and bees.\nThe lights in the sky are the answer Star-man,\nThey are part of the world we observe\nBut they must be something separate, they look small and far away,\nAnd why Star-man, does it matter?”\nThe Star-man looks pensively, tiredly at the man,\nA grown man, wondering about his place, about his mattering.\nThe stick in his hand a weapon, his body a barrier.\n“The world is very old,\nAnd yes the stars are older, much older still,\nAnd yet there is older, the unknown.”\nThe Star-man observes the man,\nHis hands are busy with wicker and sword.\n“We come from peoples like us, and our children will follow.\nThey had ancient wisdom and it was also like ours.\nAncient wisdom is not practical advice, it is a canvas,\nA landscape, a world where things can grow.\nNow remember this world is very old,\nSo our mother and grandmothers have been here once before,\nMade this world for us, and now it is our turn.”\nThe father bows to the Star-man, and shuffles back to his tent,\nAs he lays down to rest, he thinks and feels quite content.\nHe has grown and yet can grow more.\nThe sound of mother comes through the door,\nA shiver tells him he has been here before.\nHe merrily gurgles, she shields him from the cold,\nHer ancient smooth melody\n“The world is very old.”"
